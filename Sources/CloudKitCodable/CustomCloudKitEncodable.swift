/// Base protocol for types that can be represented as a `CKRecord`.
///
/// This protocol is the base for both ``CustomCloudKitEncodable`` and ``CustomCloudKitDecodable``.
/// 
/// Its only requirement that doesn't have a default implementation is ``CloudKitRecordRepresentable/cloudKitSystemFields``, which is a required
/// property for all types that can be encoded as a `CKRecord` and decoded from a `CKRecord`.
///
/// The ``CloudKitRecordRepresentable/cloudKitRecordType`` and ``CloudKitRecordRepresentable/cloudKitIdentifier``
/// allow you to customize the CloudKit record type and record name.
///
/// - note: You probably don't want to conform to `CloudKitRecordRepresentable` by itself.
/// Declare conformance to ``CustomCloudKitCodable`` instead, which will include the requirements from this protocol,
/// as well as support for encoding/decoding.

    /// store this data with your model, be it on a database, the filesystem, or wherever you're storing local data. Doing this ensures that CloudKit's sync
    /// functionality will recognize the model across devices and allow for conflict resolution, preventing issues with duplicated records or data getting out of sync.
    /// If you're just storing/retrieving data on the public database or just not using CloudKit's advanced sync capabilities, then it's less important to keep this metadata around.
    /// Think of whether you're going to be uploading the same "instance" of your model to CloudKit multiple times, for example to update some of its properties.
